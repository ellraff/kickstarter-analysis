# An Analysis of kickstarter Campaigns

The goal of this analysis was to assist a hypothetical kickstarter fund for a  
woman trying to raise money for a play. The majority of the project was to  
utilize the data to learn different data analysis methods in order to understand  
large amounts of data quickly.  The end goal was to determine whether a musical  
in Great Britain with a funding goal of 4,000 pounds would be successful based on  
the data.

As you can see from the box plot above which has been specified for musical  
kickstarter funds from Great Britain, the average goal is around $4,000 but the  
median is $2,000. Also the resultant pledges don't even reach the $4,000 mark  
and 75% of them reside below the $2,000 mark.  Due to these results, if the  
hypothetical woman was to continue her project, she is far more likely to succeed  
with a lower funding goal closed to $2,000 if not, less than that.

This may be impossible to acheive but with statistics like this, her current goal  
would most likely fail.
